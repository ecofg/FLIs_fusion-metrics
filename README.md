# FLIs_fusion-metrics
We hypothesized that the hierarchy theory in the landscape pattern structures could notably reduce the loss of hierarchy information, and the information entropy could quantitatively describe the vertical status of landscape units.
We created a general fusion formula for common simple LPIs based on two-grade land use data, and derived 3 fusion landscape pattern indicators
